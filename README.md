# Simple web project 

### This project was done with the purpose to help me apply what I was learning. It is a simple Web application that register, log in and generate a profile for the registered user. It was built on the angular-seed https://github.com/angular/angular-seed. The technologies that were used: AngularJS + AngularFire + Firebase.

## The features are:

* Registering
* Login in
* Changing profile picture

Just download the project and run on terminal "npm install" and then "sudo npm start". 

If the command doesn't run on the first time, create an folder called **"lib"** inside **app** folder: **SimpleSingInSingUp/app/lib** and then copy the following libraries from **node_modules** folder into **lib** folder: angular, angularfire, angular-loader, angular-mocks, angular-route, bootstrap, firebase, html5-boilerplate and jquery.
