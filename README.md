# Simple web project 

### This project was done with the purpose to help me apply what I was learning. It is a simple Web application that register, log in and generate a profile for the registered user. It was built on the angular-seed https://github.com/angular/angular-seed. The technologies that were used: AngularJS + AngularFire + Firebase.

## The features are:

* Registering
* Login in
* Changing profile picture

Just download the project and run on terminal "npm install", if it doesn't work try with **sudo** "sudo npm install", and then "npm start".
